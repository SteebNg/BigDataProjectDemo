YOU!!!! YES YOU!!!!! PAY ATTENTION
Read this with your GOD DAMN EYES. "I didn't see this notice" is NOT an excuse.

Make sure the INTI logo png and the csv file is at the SAME file location as the python code file. 

Don't come to us and wine to us "The error shows no such file exists" like a god damn cry baby.
